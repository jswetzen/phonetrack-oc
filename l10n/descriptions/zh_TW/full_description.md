# PhoneTrack Nextcloud application

📱 PhoneTrack is a Nextcloud application to track and store mobile devices locations.

🗺 It receives information from mobile phones logging apps and displays it dynamically on a map.

🌍 Help us to translate this app on [PhoneTrack Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/phonetrack).

How to use PhoneTrack :

* Create a tracking session.
* Give the logging link\* to the mobile devices. Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.
* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.

(\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). 替換 ‘‘你的名稱’’ 只有在Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS這3款程式的設定中設定裝置名稱才有效。

在手機追踪程式主畫面檢視一段追踪任務時，你可以：

* 📍 顯示位置歷史記錄
* ⛛ 篩選記錄點
* ✎ 手動 編輯/新增/刪除 記錄點
* ✎ 總輯裝置 (重新命名，變更色彩/形狀，移動到其他裝置)
* ⛶ 定義裝置的地理圍欄區域
* ⚇ 定義裝置間近接警報
* 🖧 Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)
* 🔗 Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)
* 🖫 Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)
* 🗠 Display sessions statistics
* 🔒 [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorized user can log with this name
* 🗓 Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)
* ◔ Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)

Public page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.

This app is tested on Nextcloud 17 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.

This app is compatible with theming colors and accessibility themes !

This app is under development.
